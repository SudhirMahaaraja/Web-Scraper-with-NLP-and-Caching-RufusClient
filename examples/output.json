Through our liberal arts and sciences curriculum, you'll discover how to use your passions to build a bright future. We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family and you plan on applying for financial aid, the fee will be waived. Please follow the steps below to request a fee waiver: Common Application Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir Transfer Applicants There is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard. Academic accomplishment in high school is important, but the Admissions Committee also considers many other criteria, such as community involvement, leadership and distinction in extracurricular activities, and personal qualities and character. We rely on teachers, counselors, and alumni to share information with us about an applicant's strength of character, their ability to overcome adversity, and other personal qualities. Harvard will accept the SAT or ACT to meet the standardized testing requirement. In exceptional cases, when those are not accessible for a student, one of the following can meet the requirement: English language proficiency examinations such as the TOEFL, IELTS and Duolingo cannot be used to meet the standardized testing requirement, though students are welcome to submit them for review as part of their application materials.  Students may self report their standardized test scores. If the cost of taking the SAT or ACT is of concern, keep in mind that both the College Board and ACT provide fee waivers to some domestic students from low-income families. Students who are non-US citizens attending secondary schools outside the US are not typically eligible for SAT or ACT fee waivers. If applicants are ineligible for fee waivers, but still face financial hardship in paying for a SAT or ACT, the Admissions Committee still encourages these students to apply. We encourage students in this situation to take and submit results from other standardized tests to which they have greater access. For instance, students lacking access to the SAT or ACT may submit AP or GCSE results, IB/A-level/other national leaving exam predictions or results.   The supplement includes five required short-answer questions, each with a 150 word limit. We want to ensure that every student has the same opportunity to reflect on and share how their life experiences and academic and extracurricular activities shaped them, how they will engage with others at Harvard, and their aspirations for the future. Our continued focus is on considering the whole student in the admissions process and how they have interacted with the world. Restrictive Early Action applicants are notified by mid-December.  Regular Decision applicants will be notified by the end of March.  \n\n  Crimson Pride\n \n\n  Harvard is home to 42 Division I intercollegiate sports teams - more than any other college in the country.\n  \n\n  Innovation\n \nFrom physical spaces to funding, Harvard provides the support for students to investigate and explore their world.\n From physical spaces to funding, Harvard provides the support for students to investigate and explore their world. \n\n  Groundbreaking Research\n \nUndergraduates have access to more than $7 million in funding to pursue research in the sciences, social sciences, arts, or humanities.\n Undergraduates have access to more than $7 million in funding to pursue research in the sciences, social sciences, arts, or humanities. \n\n  Creative Expression\n \n\n  Theater, Dance, and Media - one of Harvard's newest concentrations - is just one of the many pathways in the arts and humanities.\n  Harvard is affordable for all admitted students.
