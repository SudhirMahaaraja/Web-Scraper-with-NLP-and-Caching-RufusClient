## Documentation for RAG Pipeline Integration

To effectively integrate the web scraper into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, follow these comprehensive steps:

### 1. Data Retrieval
- **Objective**: Fetch relevant data from the web based on user queries or predefined topics.
- **Implementation**:
  - Instantiate the `Crawler` class, which is responsible for web scraping.
  - Configure the crawler with the target URLs, search terms, and any specific filters (e.g., only fetching articles from certain domains).
  - Utilize the `fetch_data()` method to initiate the scraping process. This method should return raw HTML data, which will be used in the subsequent steps.
  
```python
crawler = Crawler(target_urls=["https://example.com"], search_terms=["machine learning"])
raw_data = crawler.fetch_data()
```

### 2. Data Processing
- **Objective**: Clean and structure the fetched HTML content for better usability and relevance.
- **Implementation**:
  - Utilize the `ContentExtractor` class to process the raw HTML data.
  - Implement methods to:
    - Extract meaningful text from the HTML.
    - Remove unnecessary tags, scripts, and styles that do not contribute to the content.
    - Normalize the data, which can include lowercasing text and removing special characters.
- **Example**:
```python
content_extractor = ContentExtractor()
processed_data = content_extractor.clean(raw_data)
```

### 3. Embedding Generation
- **Objective**: Convert processed text content into embeddings for efficient retrieval and similarity calculations.
- **Implementation**:
  - Pass the cleaned and structured content through the `EmbeddingModel`, which utilizes models like BERT or Sentence Transformers.
  - Store the generated embeddings in a suitable format (e.g., a list or database) for later retrieval.
  
```python
embedding_model = EmbeddingModel()
embeddings = embedding_model.generate_embeddings(processed_data)
```

### 4. Query Processing
- **Objective**: Convert user queries into a format compatible with the embedding model.
- **Implementation**:
  - When a user inputs a query, preprocess it similarly to the fetched content (cleaning, normalization).
  - Use the `EmbeddingModel` to embed the user query, ensuring it aligns with the content embeddings for effective comparison.
  
```python
user_query = "What are the latest trends in machine learning?"
query_embedding = embedding_model.embed_query(user_query)
```

### 5. Similarity Calculation
- **Objective**: Identify the most relevant content based on similarity to the user query.
- **Implementation**:
  - Compute the similarity between the query embeddings and the embeddings of the retrieved content using cosine similarity or another metric.
  - Implement a filtering mechanism to select content that meets or exceeds a predefined similarity threshold, ensuring only relevant results are returned.
  
```python
similarity_scores = calculate_similarity(query_embedding, embeddings)
relevant_content = filter_content(processed_data, similarity_scores, threshold=0.75)
```

### 6. Final Output
- **Objective**: Present the most relevant content to the user in a clear and accessible format.
- **Implementation**:
  - Format the output to enhance readability (e.g., presenting excerpts, summaries, or full articles).
  - Optionally, provide links to the original sources for further exploration.
  
```python
for content in relevant_content:
    print(f"Title: {content.title}\nExcerpt: {content.excerpt}\nLink: {content.url}\n")
```

### Additional Considerations
- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling at each stage of the pipeline to manage issues like network failures or content processing errors.
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitor performance, especially during the embedding generation and similarity calculation phases, to identify and mitigate bottlenecks.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests for each class and function to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the entire pipeline.
