## Summary of the Approach

This project aims to create a robust web scraper capable of navigating diverse web landscapes while efficiently extracting meaningful data. The approach centers around three main components: Crawling, Caching, and NLP Processing.

### 1. Crawling
- **Objective**: The goal of the crawling component is to systematically explore and collect data from web pages while adhering to ethical standards and maintaining server health.

- **Crawler Class**:
  - **Respecting `robots.txt`**:
    - The crawler begins by checking the `robots.txt` file of each target domain. This file outlines the rules for web crawlers, specifying which pages may or may not be crawled.
    - By implementing a robot parser, the crawler dynamically adjusts its crawling behavior based on the permissions outlined in `robots.txt`, ensuring ethical compliance.
  
  - **Rate Limiting**:
    - To prevent overloading servers and to reduce the likelihood of getting blocked, a rate-limiting mechanism is integrated. This mechanism introduces a controlled pause between consecutive requests to the same domain.
    - The delay can be fine-tuned based on the site's server response time and traffic patterns, optimizing the crawler's efficiency while maintaining respect for web server capacities.

  - **HTML Parsing with BeautifulSoup**:
    - The crawler leverages **BeautifulSoup** to parse HTML content. This library simplifies the process of navigating the complex structure of web pages, allowing for the extraction of relevant data.
    - It can handle malformed HTML gracefully, ensuring that essential data is still accessible even when the HTML structure varies significantly across different websites.

  - **Link Extraction for Depth Crawling**:
    - After fetching and parsing a web page, the crawler extracts internal and external links. This enables it to continue exploring related content, effectively creating a web of connected information.
    - The crawler can also prioritize links based on their relevance or freshness, ensuring that it focuses on the most valuable content first.

- **Example Implementation**:
```python
from crawler import Crawler

# Initialize the Crawler with target URLs
crawler = Crawler(target_urls=["https://example.com"])
crawler.crawl()
```

### 2. Caching
- **Objective**: The caching component aims to optimize the performance of the web scraper by reducing redundant data retrieval, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

- **Cache Class**:
  - **Data Storage**:
    - The Cache class stores previously fetched data in a structured format (e.g., JSON files or a lightweight database). This allows for quick retrieval of content that has already been processed.
    - Each cache entry includes metadata such as the URL, fetched content, and timestamps, which aids in managing and validating cached data.

  - **Cache Expiration Management**:
    - A robust cache expiration strategy is implemented, where data is marked stale after a predefined duration. This ensures that users receive the most current information without manual intervention.
    - The expiration policy can be tailored based on the type of content; for example, rapidly changing news articles may have a shorter expiration period compared to more static content like product descriptions.

  - **Cache Lookup**:
    - Before making a web request, the scraper first checks the cache to see if the requested content is already available. If it is, the cached version is returned, significantly speeding up response times and reducing load on web servers.

- **Example Implementation**:
```python
from cache import Cache

# Initialize the Cache
cache = Cache(cache_file='cache.json')

# Store data in cache
cache.store(url, response_data)

# Retrieve cached data if available
cached_data = cache.retrieve(url)
if cached_data:
    process_data(cached_data)
else:
    response_data = fetch_data(url)
    cache.store(url, response_data)
```

### 3. NLP Processing
- **Objective**: The NLP processing component focuses on deriving meaningful insights from the crawled content, enhancing the user experience by providing relevant and contextually accurate information.

- **TextProcessor Class**:
  - **Content Cleaning and Normalization**:
    - The TextProcessor class preprocesses the fetched content by removing unnecessary HTML tags, special characters, and irrelevant sections. This step is crucial for ensuring that the data is clean and ready for analysis.
    - Text normalization techniques such as stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal are applied to improve the quality of the extracted information.

  - **Embedding Generation**:
    - Processed content is passed to an **EmbeddingModel** that transforms textual data into vector representations. These embeddings capture semantic meanings and relationships between texts.
    - The embeddings facilitate more nuanced comparisons between user queries and available content, improving the relevance of search results.

  - **Text Similarity Calculation**:
    - When a user submits a query, it is embedded using the same model as the crawled content. The similarity between the userâ€™s query and the content embeddings is calculated, allowing the scraper to identify the most relevant pieces of information.
    - A predefined similarity threshold filters out content that does not meet a certain relevance score, ensuring that only the most pertinent results are returned.

  - **Final Output Formatting**:
    - The most relevant content is returned to the user in a well-structured format, enhancing readability. This could include summarization, bullet points, or categorization based on the content type.

- **Example Implementation**:
```python
from text_processor import TextProcessor

# Initialize the TextProcessor and EmbeddingModel
text_processor = TextProcessor()
embedding_model = EmbeddingModel()

# Process crawled content
cleaned_data = text_processor.clean(raw_data)
embeddings = embedding_model.generate_embeddings(cleaned_data)

# Process user query
query_embeddings = embedding_model.generate_embeddings(user_query)

# Calculate similarity and retrieve relevant results
relevant_content = find_similar_content(query_embeddings, embeddings)
```
